Maria Goldshtein  (she/her): In w is our computational tools relying on machine learning processes to evaluate writing a number you eat systems involved at least three entities with different roles and goals and needs teachers student and tool.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:27.960
Maria Goldshtein  (she/her): We use to unleash relational trust framework and consider existing concerns and stances and the sources for those tenses to develop and formed a w eat responsibility and resilience.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.330
Maria Goldshtein  (she/her): Here is an outline of the different parties goals, and we also outline different States of trust.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.890
Maria Goldshtein  (she/her): uniquely to aws either tools are developed from human writers data and human raiders evaluation which may include bias.

5
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:55.260
Maria Goldshtein  (she/her): Speakers or non standards dialects may have concerns about the tools evaluation, leading to mistrust knowing this the system can strategize through the Web tool.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:11.190
Maria Goldshtein  (she/her): To conclude, the relational framework captures the dynamic nature of interaction and the system we consider unique a web trust concerns and explore ways in which design and implementation can address potential conflict through responsibility, thank you.
